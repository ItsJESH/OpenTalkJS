In twilight's hush, where shadows play,
The forest whispers secrets of the day.
A midnight wind stirs, rustling leaves,
As earth and sky conspire to breathe.

The trees stand tall, their branches wide,
A cathedral arching, side by side.
Their trunks, a sturdy column strong,
Support the canopy above, all night long.

In this still hour, where darkness reigns,
A million stars appear, like diamonds in the plain.
The moon, a glowing orb of white,
Casts silver light upon the forest's night.

The creatures of the wild, they too,
Are stirring, awakening anew.
The birds, a chorus, sing their song,
As nature awakens, and all is right.

In this vast tapestry, we're but a part,
A delicate thread, in nature's heart.
Our spirits soar, as wild things do,
And in the beauty of the world, we find our truth.
