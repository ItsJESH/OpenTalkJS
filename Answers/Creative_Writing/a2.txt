In twilight's hush, where shadows play,
The forest stirs, and night's sweet sway,
A million stars above do twinkle bright,
As earthy scents and whispers take flight.

The trees, like sentinels of old,
Stand guard, their leaves a gentle fold,
Their branches swaying to the breeze,
In rhythm with the wind's soft ease.

The river flows, a silver stream,
Through valleys green, where wildflowers beam,
Their petals dancing in the dew,
A colorful spectacle anew.

The mountain peaks, a rugged crown,
Touch heavens high, and touch the dawn,
Their snow-capped grandeur, stark and bold,
Inviting all to tales of old.

In this vast realm, we find our place,
A small but vital, sacred space,
Where earth's abundance and beauty reign,
And in its heart, our souls remain.

So let us cherish this wondrous land,
And honor nature's gentle hand,
For in her beauty, we find our way,
And in her wisdom, a brighter day.
